                This metaverse project is one of the big projects I did. I did a lot of complex systems in this project, but to put it simply, I did the multiplayer system and the 3D mechanics. This metaverse was a team effort.

                I made this game because I was bored. It took me about 2-3 days to make this game. I did all the design and mechanics of this game. Also this is my first game published on crazygames. You can buy the codes for this game on CodeCanyon.

                This game is one of the games I made to sell the source code. I made the game in about 5-6 hours. It's a basic assembly game. It is available on codecanyon if you want to buy it.

            <p>
                This is a game I'm surprised I was able to make. Because I made this game with a game engine that doesn't fully support 3d. The game is a simple counter-strike clone but I think it's a good game because I made a 2D game engine. If you want to play it or buy the source code this game is available on itch.io.
